<h2>Profile</h2>
<body>
    Operations analyst – also responsible for handling the company’s financial reports and analysis, 
    I have proactively learnt to use Javascript, Python and SQL programming languages to 
    perform more efficiently in my current role, which requires handling, processing and 
    analysing large amounts of data. I am always looking for new ways to streamline 
    and improve processes. This has ranged from identifying and then addressing errors that 
    occur frequently, to creating new reports, or suggesting and tracking new KPI’s. 
    <br>I have also obtained the certified Cloud practitioner qualification, and I am doing side projects 
    in my own time to improve my skills within the Cloud.
    I have improved processes in various departments throughout the business, both through automating 
    jobs that were previously very labour intensive and providing new information and reports which 
    have further enhanced efficiency. I have been credited with improving departments to such an 
    extent, that I have been asked to coach others. I believe that my experience shows me to be a 
    resourceful, highly competent and dependable person who is constantly looking to learn and improve.
