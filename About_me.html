  <h2>About me</h2>  
  
 Hello, thanks for checking out my first website! The rest of this it is more professional 
 and perhaps a bit formal, so I wanted to add a section to tell you a little about myself. 
 I'm an avid reader, I've even gone through the full Wheel of Time series twice, 
 yes even those middle few, if you've read them, you'll understand the pain.
 I'm also big rugby fan, I used to be a big rugby player, 
 but nowdays I prefer sitting in the stands watching other people hurl themselves at each
 other over a chunky rubber egg.<br><br>
 Like many people I got into coding and Cloud during lockdown, when I grabbed onto it like a 
 starving man in the desert. It gave me something to focus on at a time when I desperately
 needed it, however after the lockdowns started easing and things started opening up again, I found 
 that my love of coding didn't wane, if anything it ramped up, the more I learned, the more I wanted to 
 know. It didn't matter if it was Python or Javascript, Linux or Cloud, every time I turned over a rock 
 I found 10 things I didn't understand, and that was so exciting.
 <br><br>
 At the time I was studying to be a chartered accountant, it was fine, and I was very good at it, but it 
 got to the point where I was having to do my accounting study before coding/cloud, because if I didn't, 
 the accountancy wouldn't get a look in. Now I'd put a number of years into the accountancy study,
 but you don't need to be an accountant to know that the sunk cost fallacy is not a compelling argument.
 So after talking it over with friends, family, and even my boss, I decided to make the switch
 and go all in on cloud.
 <br><br>
 Well if you've made it this far, thank you sincerely for taking the time out of your day 
 to get to know me
 a bit. Hopefully we'll be able to have a less one sided conversation in the future.
 <br><br>
 As a side note, if you're thinking about getting into cloud, but aren't sure where to start,  
 I wrote a blog on <a href = "https://dev.to/ajmclaug1/cloud-resume-challenge-4k99" target="_blank">Dev.to</a> 
 about how I provisioned this website using AWS.
